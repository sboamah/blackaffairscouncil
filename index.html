  <div class="paragraph" style="color:#000; text-align: center;"> The Black Affairs Council aims to build a sense and represent the entirety of the black community 
    with students, administrative staff  and various affiliated organizations within Stevens Institute of Technology. 
    Using the collaborative efforts of all of the Black leaders on campus and administrative staff, we hope to give those 
    that identify with the black race opportunities to voice their opinions, develop educational opportunities, enhance 
    cultural awareness, and provide support to other under-resourced communities outside of Stevens.</div>
